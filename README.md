## Decisions

- ‚úÖ Architecture: Clean Architecture
  - I decided to use clean architecture because with it we can divide the project into layers,
  isolate our domain and business rules from external libraries and ensure decoupling, quality, sustainability and scalability of the project.
  - I decided to use Test-Driven Development and Development tooling to ensure the quality and security of the API.
